## Video Demo

## Future Improvements
  * Adding multiple difficulty settings (i.e., modifying the correlation between score and speed over time)
  * Throwing in randomly generated obstacles that the player must avoid (currently the only obstacles causing death are the snake pit borders and the snake body itself)
  * Offering new themes
  * Installing sound effects and possibly background music
